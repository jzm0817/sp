### section 1: C++ data structures

This section covers important parts of the **C++ standard library**, especially container data structures. We also continue to explore **memory and data representation**.

#### C++â€™s Standard Template Library (STL)
C++ comes with a large library of useful data structures, including resizable arrays (<font color='orange'>std::vector</font>), linked lists (<font color='orange'>std::list</font>), ordered search trees (<font color='orange'>std::map</font>), hash tables (<font color='orange'>std::unordered_map</font>), and sets (<font color='orange'>std::set</font> and <font color='orange'>std::unordered_set</font>). It also comes with a library of useful algorithms, including <font color='orange'>std::sort</font> (sorting) and <font color='orange'>std::lower_bound</font> (binary searching). You may notice these structures and algorithms in handout code, and you may want to use these data structures yourself.

##### <font color='orange'>std::vector</font>(resizable array)
<font color='orange'>std::vector<T></font>represents an array of objects of type T that can **dynamically change size**. Access into <font color='orange'>std::vector</font> is **as fast as access into a normal array**, even though elements can be added and removed at runtime.

**Exercise**. Write code that creates a vector containing 5 copies of the C string "HI".
